# 🌱 gr33n

**An open-source agricultural operating system designed to reclaim data, land, and autonomy.**

## 🚜 What Is gr33n?

gr33n is a modular, scalable, and decentralized farm management system built for real humans—not cloud landlords. Whether you’re managing a homestead on solar or automating thousands of acres, gr33n adapts to your size, ethics, and bandwidth.

It’s PostgreSQL schemas + APIs + front ends + microcontrollers + shared insert statements.

But more than that: **it’s a political stance in schema form.**

## 🧬 Why gr33n Exists

> _"If your DNA, soil, labor, and climate data feed trillion-dollar industries—and you’re not seeing a dime—that's not tech, that’s extraction."_

This project exists because:
- Big Ag is closing the loop on food systems, and we’re cracking it back open.
- Data rights matter—even your soil and sunlight deserve consent.
- Billionaires shouldn’t profit off your greenhouse or genome without giving back.
- Farmers, tinkerers, and off-gridders deserve tools that don’t call home.

### ⚠️ What Does “Don't Call Home” Mean?

That means gr33n will never require a permanent internet connection, forced login, or hidden “check-in” with third-party servers. Whether you're on an island, a mountaintop, or a mesh-netted greenhouse, gr33n works *where you live*, without compromise.

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **📦 Modularity**  
  Each ag domain (crops, animals, KNF inputs, IoT sensors) lives in its own schema. Use what you need, prune the rest.

- **🌐 Connectivity Optional**  
  Works offline, intranet-only, or online. Supports Supabase or baremetal Postgres with TimescaleDB/PostGIS.

- **🧰 Automation-Ready**  
  Schedule tasks, trigger actuators, run AI models—or run it all manually. Your tech, your tempo.

- **💾 Insert Commons Coming Soon**  
  A sibling repo for community-contributed data (pest trials, IMO recipes, soil logs) with scrubbers and staging.

## 📖 The Commons, Explained

> _"Built for the commons."_  
> The commons means shared knowledge, shared code, shared resilience. It’s an ancient concept—like the village well or a seed bank—remixed into digital space. gr33n lives in this tradition: free to use, fork, and rebuild, not fenced off behind corporate toll booths.

## 🔥 Project Roadmap

- [x] gr33n_core schema (users, sensors, schedules, zones)
- [x] Modular farming schemas (crops, inventory, natural_farming, etc)
- [ ] Golang backend with REST + pubsub support
- [ ] Front end with complexity pruning by farm type
- [ ] Microcontroller integrations (MQTT + field tasking)
- [ ] Data insert pipeline (scrubbing, approval, federation-ready)
