# Guardian QA — optional nightly CI (self-hosted)

**Audience:** Operators and maintainers with a **self-hosted GitHub Actions runner** (or equivalent) that has **Ollama** and enough CPU/GPU to run `make guardian-qa-smoke`.

**Not for GitHub-hosted runners** — they have no Ollama and smoke runs take 30–90 minutes on a CPU laptop.

**Related:** [Phase 131 plan](plans/phase_131_guardian_qa_harness.plan.md) · [local-operator-bootstrap.md](local-operator-bootstrap.md) § Guardian QA · [Phase 129–139 closure](plans/phase-129-139-closure.md)

## What runs

| Target | When | Output |
|--------|------|--------|
| `make guardian-qa-smoke MODEL=phi3:mini FARM_ID=1` | After Guardian changes; optional nightly/weekly | `data/guardian_qa_runs/<timestamp>_smoke_phi3-mini.json` |
| `make guardian-qa-regression MODEL=phi3:mini` | Pre-release (slow) | Same directory, regression suite |
| `make guardian-qa-manual` | Human UI parity | Prints checklist from same fixtures |

Set `GUARDIAN_EVAL_TOKEN` (JWT from dev login) and optionally `GUARDIAN_EVAL_LOG=/tmp/gr33n-api.log` for log correlation.

## Example workflow (documented pattern — not enabled in default repo CI)

Save as `.github/workflows/guardian-qa-nightly.yml` **only on a fork/site with a self-hosted runner** tagged `ollama`:

```yaml
name: guardian-qa-smoke

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 1'  # weekly Monday 06:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  guardian-smoke:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, ollama]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Start stack
        run: |
          make compose-db-up
          make migrate
          # Start API + seed as your site requires; smoke needs live /v1/chat

      - name: Guardian QA smoke
        env:
          GUARDIAN_EVAL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GUARDIAN_EVAL_TOKEN }}
          GUARDIAN_EVAL_LOG: /tmp/gr33n-api.log
        run: make guardian-qa-smoke MODEL=phi3:mini FARM_ID=1

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: guardian-qa-${{ github.run_id }}
          path: data/guardian_qa_runs/
          retention-days: 30
```

## Pass criteria (v1 — heuristics, not LLM-as-judge)

Smoke uses **recorded JSON + heuristic checks** (answer length, citation count, optional log scrape for `walk_farm`). **Heuristic pass ≠ operator-quality pass** — see [smoke report 2026-07-07](guardian-qa-smoke-report-20260707.md) and [Phase 143](plans/phase_143_guardian_answer_quality.plan.md) for leak/URL/pH hardening. Human review of archived runs and **thumbs feedback** ([Phase 134](plans/phase_134_guardian_answer_feedback.plan.md)) is the quality loop — **LLM-as-judge is explicitly deferred** (see Phase 131 non-goals).

**After smoke:** Settings → Guardian feedback ([runbook](guardian-feedback-review-runbook.md)) · Settings → Guardian QA last run (Phase 140).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|--------|
| Timeouts on CPU | `make guardian-laptop-tune ARGS="--apply"`; use smoke model `phi3:mini`; raise `LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` |
| Missing `walk_farm` in logs | `./scripts/guardian-qa-scrape-logs.sh --expect walk_farm` |
| Warmup HTTP 503 before grounded smoke | Eval now sends `chat_model` matching `-models`; ensure `phi3:mini` is installed when `.env` `LLM_MODEL` is tinyllama |
| 401 on eval | Refresh `GUARDIAN_EVAL_TOKEN`; API must be `AUTH_MODE=dev` or `auth_test` |

---

## Non-goals

- Mandatory PR gate on every push (too slow, LLM-flaky on shared CI)
- GitHub-hosted runner without Ollama
- Automated LLM grading of answer quality (deferred to a future phase when GPU CI is stable)
